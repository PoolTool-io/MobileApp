# PoolTool Mobile App

PoolTool is an online platform built to facilitate the interaction between SPOs and their stakeholders. 
Our goal is to provide our users with useful tools and the most up-to-date information on Cardano, including staking, 
in-depth research and exclusive offers from SPOs.

## Development

This project is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs), and uses [Flutter Version Management (FVM)](https://fvm.app/)

To begin development on this project, ensure that FVM is installed. Then navigate to project directory and run the 
command below to install the version of Flutter found in project `.fvm/fvm_config.json`:

```shell
fvm install
```

Go to project root and execute the following command in console to get the required dependencies:

```
fvm flutter pub get 
```

Various scripts used in development are available under the `scripts` property in `pubspec.yaml`.
